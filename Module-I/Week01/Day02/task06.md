# Code review flow at Microverse

## Learning objectives

- Understand the standard code review process with GitHub pull requests.
- Understand the Microverse Program code review flow.

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

At Microverse we use [the standard code review process with GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/features/code-review/). In addition, we keep our own internal queue of code review requests. That means that when you request a code review, the request is queued until the code reviewer is assigned.

Therefore, once you have your pull request ready you need to add it to our queue - you can do that via the Student Dashboard. After you add your pull request to our queue our code reviewers will know that you need some feedback. This lesson shows you step-by-step what needs to happen.


### Why is it important?

You will be using this flow in all your Microverse projects. We recommend keeping this list open while working on your first projects. In later projects you should remember it without needing to look at the list for each project.
In your future job, you won't be using the Microverse Student Dashboard but all other steps will remain similar. Therefore, following these steps on all of your projects will give you the advantage of already being familiar with the code review process.
