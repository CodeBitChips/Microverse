# Introduction to peer-to-peer code reviews

## Learning objectives
- Understand the code review process as a team effort.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

Peer-to-peer code review is an activity you will perform with your team a few times per week.
You will select one person who will present their recently written code, and the rest of your team will perform a code review.

### Why is it important?

You might find the thought of presenting your code a little intimidating. 
Still, it is beneficial to practice the skills necessary to work in the development industry. 
You will increase your confidence, learn how to respond to feedback professionally, and improve the quality of your code. 
Code review also helps the other participants learn how to give constructive feedback professionally and politely. 
Developing all of these skills is essential if you want to get a job when you complete the program - and keep it!

### How to prepare for peer-to-peer code review sessions

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Today, you **do not need** to perform any peer-to-peer code review sessions.*
*Your current task is to get yourself familiar with the scenario of this kind of meeting, so you can smoothly perform it with your team when the time comes.*

- Read the description of the [peer-to-peer code review meeting scenario](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/live-peer-to-peer-reviews.md).
- Refresh yourself on [what to check](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/give_code_review_basics.md#what-to-check) during a code review.
- Refresh yourself on [how to communicate](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/give_code_review_basics.md#how-to-communicate) while giving a code review.
- **IMPORTANT NOTE:** During peer-to-peer code reviews, you ***should not*** leave comments in opened pull requests. Instead, you will open a GitHub issue. Make sure that you understand [how to open a GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue).
