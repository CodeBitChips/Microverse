# Pair programming - record your session

## Learning objectives
- Demonstrate the ability to work as a navigator while pair programming.
- Demonstrate the ability to work as a driver while pair programming.

### Estimated time: 2h

## Exercise

### Instructions

Your task is to record a video of the pair programming session which could serve as a good example for other people.
You will need to show that you are good at both roles - the driver and the navigator.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

During your pair programming session, you need to make changes to your code to ensure that you use only `float`s for positioning the list of technologies listed in each project description:

<p align="center">
    <img src="./images/tech-list.png" alt="Technologies list" width="300px" />
  </p>
  
We included a screenshot of Template 5 for reference, but you should follow the template that you chose.

**Your goal is to record a video about pair programming, not to fully implement that change. It is ok if you don't finish it.**

- Join a call with your pair programming partner(s). **IMPORTANT: use Zoom desktop app - thanks to that you will be able to record your meeting.**
- Invite your partner(s) to [collaboarate in your GitHub repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).
- Share your screen.
- Start recording your meeting (choose option: "Record on this Computer").
- Create a new branch in your portfolio project.
- Start pair programming as described in the article [Pair programming at Microverse](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046209594).
- You should switch roles after 5 minutes to make the entire video shorter.
    - First round: student A is the navigator and student B is the driver.
    - Second round: student B is the navigator and student A is the driver.
    - Third round: student A is the navigator and student B is the driver.
- *Note: if you work in a group of 3, record a video that shows each of you playing the role of both the driver and the navigator.*
    - *First round: student A is the navigator and student B is the driver.*
    - *Second round: student B is the navigator and student C is the driver.*
    - *Third round: student C is the navigator and student A is the driver.*
- Do **not** open a pull request from your branch and do **not** merge that code to the main branch. Your portfolio should remain the way you originally coded it, with styling being doing with CSS Grid, not with `float`s.
- Once you are finished recording your video, upload your recorded video to Google Drive and copy the link to your video.
