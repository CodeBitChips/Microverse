# How to ask questions on online forums

## Learning objectives
- Learn how to structure questions on online forums to get your questions answered well.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description
You have already learned how to research online resources to find answers to your questions. But what do you do if the problem that you have is very specific and has never happened to anyone else?
Even if you find a piece of existing advice somewhere on the internet for most questions you need to research, a situation like that will eventually happen to you.
Therefore you should be prepared to ask your question in a clear, detailed way that is the most likely to get you the answers you are looking for.

### Why is it important?

First, the more clearly you ask your questions, the better the chances that you will get a quick and useful response.
Second, the well-described issue can help other people who might need to solve a problem similar to yours in the future.

### What does it mean to ask questions well?

- Remember to **always** provide **the context** of your question.
- Read some techniques for how to write your questions in this article [How to ask programming questions](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/how-to-ask-programming-questions).
- Check Stack Overflow's article [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

## Challenge yourself
*Use these optional questions to check what you learned during this lesson.* 

- Reflect on programming questions you have asked in the past:
    - Did you always provide all the necessary info, or did people need to ask you many additional questions to understand your problem?
    - Did you do proper research before asking your question?
    - Did you document the solution once you found it to make other people's lives easier?
