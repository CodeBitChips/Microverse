### Instructions 
*Check out this FAQ if you need a refresher on [how to use GitHub Classroom](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-computer-science-fundamentals/blob/main/trivial-interview-questions/articles/how_to_use_github_classroom.md).*

- As this challenge should be solved by doing a pair-programming, first decide who will be the driver and who will be the navigator:
    - You won't switch roles during the challenge as you cannot invite collaborators to the private repo.
    - Make sure that you and your coding partner(s) experience both roles (the driver and the navigator) in a given week. _For example: if you were the navigator while solving the challenge yesterday, make sure that today you are the driver._
- The driver shares their screen and accepts the [Repeat a String](https://classroom.github.com/a/Clp7djMd) assignment.
- Check the instructions in the assignment README.
- Start recording your screen by using [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/).
- Try pseudocoding first.
- While solving the challenge, speak aloud and explain your thought process.
- Once you solve the challenge, copy the link to your Loom video.
-  **You need to use pair-programming for this exercise. Therefore you need to select one of the assignments in your pair-programming group in which you will implement the above instructions.**
