# Second look at the code review process

## Learning objectives

- Demonstrate ability to respond to a code review respectfully and professionally.
- Address code review comments from different team members (code reviewers) and communicate respectfully.
- Implement feedback from code reviewers to improve your project.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description 
You have received a few code reviews already, and you have also had a chance to perform code reviews. With this experience you are now ready to revisit the code review concept.

Code review is a simple process from a technical standpoint but it can be difficult because it requires a lot of communication and feedback cycles with many different people. Therefore before performing a code review it is important to put yourself into a mindset full of empathy, humility and eagerness to improve.

### Why is it important?

In your future job you will get code reviews from your team members, who may be more experienced or less experienced than you in various different aspects of coding.

Here's the bad news: usually the first code review is a somewhat frustrating experience. Imagine yourself delivering the beautiful piece of code that you have been working on for many hours and seeing several comments telling you that you could have done something better! In a worst case scenario code reviews can sometimes even encourage you to rewrite whole features using a completely different approach and encourage you to completely remove the original code for those features.

Here's the good news: If you remember that good quality code requires a team effort, you will be grateful for every comment in your code review. Code review is not a message to you that something is wrong with your code, it is a message that your code can still be improved. And many times code review can protect you from making the same mistakes that others made before you.

Practicing the code review process at Microverse can save you a lot of frustration in your first job.

### Challenge yourself

Take time to reflect on your code reviews. Ask yourself the following questions:
- Do I prepare my pull requests well for code reviews?
- Do I approach code reviews with humility, and perceive code reviews as opportunities to learn?
- Do I communicate prefessionaly with code reviewers?
- Do I apply code review best practices when I give code reviews during the morning sessions?
