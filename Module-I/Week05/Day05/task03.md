## Data structures

Let's start with the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure):

>In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

The data structure is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in memory.

### Why is it important?

As a programmer, you will be using different data structures daily. That's why testing your knowledge about data structures is a part of the majority of job interviews.

The same as in the case of algorithms, learning about data structures will prepare you:

- For projects that you will build during the Microverse program.
- For future job interviews.
- For your future job's challenges.

### What data structures should I know?

- Read the intro to [Data Structures Tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-tutorial) by Java Point to get a general understanding of the types of data structures. You can also look around to check the names of the most common data structures. **Do not read too deeply on the specific data structures.** You will do that in the following lessons.
- Read [The top data structures you should know for your next coding interview](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-top-data-structures-you-should-know-for-your-next-coding-interview-36af0831f5e3/) by freeCodeCamp. Again you only need to know the names of the different data structures, not precisely how they work or what they are used for. You will get to know them in more detail in the following lessons.
