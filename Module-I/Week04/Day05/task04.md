# Bugs: hide-and-seek

## Learning objectives

- Locate a bug using manual QA methods.
- Understand the importance of thoughtful, intentional problem-solving.
- Identify how developer tools are used in debugging front-end code.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

In this exercise you will work with your learning partner(s). Each person should find and fix the other person's bugs.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

### Instructions

- Each person should prepare a repository including some hidden bugs to be discovered. Spend up to 30 minutes on this part.
  - You can reuse the *portfolio* repo and introduce a bug into the repo.
  - For this exercise, limit your bugs to just the JavaScript code.
- Once bugs are prepared, clone your partner's repository (if you are in a group of 3, make sure that everybody debugs someone else's code).
- Open the project in the browser and debug it using *developer tools*.
- Fix the bug locally (don't push any changes).
- Once you have identified and understood the problem(s), open an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) in the repository, describing the bug and the possible solution.
- The link to the issue should be submitted as the outcome of this exercise.
