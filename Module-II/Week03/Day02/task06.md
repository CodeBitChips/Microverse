#  Professional skills project review flow at Microverse

## Learning objectives

- Understand the Microverse Program code review flow.

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

At Microverse you will complete a few projects that will prepare you for job searching. Your goal is to start looking for a job with high-quality materials.
Therefore, you will complete professional skills project in a series of three (Create/Update/Make final changes). All projects will be span between different blocks - so, you will receive feedback in steps.
Take a look at the following example:

- In week 2 you will work on the "Use your USP to craft the first draft of your Elevator Pitch" project.
     - You will submit a link to Google Doc with your project.
     - It will get to the review queue.
- In week 3 you will work on the "Update your Elevator Pitch based on feedback"
     - You will make changes based on feedback received after you submitted the "Use your USP to craft the first draft of your Elevator Pitch" project.
     - You will submit a link to Google Doc with the updated project.
     - It will get to the review queue.
- In week 3 you will work on the "Make final changes to the Elevator Pitch based on feedback"
    - You will make changes based on feedback received after you submitted the "Update your Elevator Pitch based on feedback" project.
    - You will ask for a review by using a link to Google Doc with the updated project.
    - It will get to the review queue.
    - You will receive feedback in the same week - the project will be approved or more changes will be requested.
    - You will submit the project as complete once you get the final approval.


### Why is it important?

You will be using this flow in all your professional projects. We recommend keeping this list open while working on your first projects. In later projects, you should remember it without needing to look at the list for each project.
