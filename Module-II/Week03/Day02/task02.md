# To test or not to test?

## Learning objectives
- Explain why testing code is important.
- Explain why manual QA is often necessary alongside unit tests.

### Estimated time: 0.5h

## Description
It should go without saying that the application's code does not go to production before it's checked by someone else other than the code's author. It is too easy to miss a bug or forget to check an edge case. That's why teams employ testers and QA engineers who check the functionality of every new feature independently from the developers who wrote it. There are various kinds of manual and automated tests, but all have the same goal - to make sure you ship error-free code.

### Why is testing important?
In essence, by testing you save time and money. If your code is well covered with automated tests, you gain confidence in it. You and your team will be able to add new features in the future without the risk of breaking existing functionality. Good tests can also be used as documentation of your application's building blocks.
