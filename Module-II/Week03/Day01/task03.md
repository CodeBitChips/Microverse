# Refresher: JavaScript best practices

## Learning objectives
- Apply JavaScript best practices and language style guides in code.

### Estimated time: 0.25h

## Description

You have already built a few projects that use JavaScript. Thanks to that, you have learned new concepts from the front-end world.
As you created those projects, we asked you to remember JavaScript best practices. Now it is time to reflect on that.

### Why is refreshing your JavaScript best practices knowledge important?

While learning new concepts, you can easily get excited about new possibilities and forget about best practices.
And following best practices will make your code more maintainable and easier to work with - for you and for other developers.

**Guiding questions:**

*Think about these questions:*

- Do I already have a habit of applying the best practices? Does it come naturally?
- Do I make some final checks on my code to verify best practices usage before asking for a code review?
- How often am I asked to make changes in my code because it does not align with the best practices?

### Refresher on JavaScript best practices

- Take a moment to read the [JavaScript best practices](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md) article again.
- Also check [JavaScript best practices](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_best_practices.asp) by _w3schools_.
- Check out [JavaScript common mistakes](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_mistakes.asp) by _w3schools_ as well.

## Additional materials
**These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.**

Read the [JavaScript style guide](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp) by  _w3schools_.
