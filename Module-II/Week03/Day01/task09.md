## Exercise

_We asked Code Reviewers to ignore any issues related to best practices or clean code rules during their reviews for your "To Do list" project._
Thanks to that, you were able to:

- Make a self-assessment of your code's quality in the [Do I follow JavaScript best practices?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/tree/main/clean-code/exercises/clean_code_self_assessment.md) exercise.
- Perform a code review for your partner in the [Does my coding partner follow JS best practices?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/tree/main/code-review/exercises/clean_code_partner_review.md) exercise.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

### Instructions 

- Apply changes requested in the code review that you have received.
- Also fix all issues that you find in the code.
- In case of any doubts, ask questions in the GitHub comments.
- Even if you agree with all review comments, leave a few comments on the feedback you received. You can comment briefly, saying "Thank you" or add an emoji.
- Ask your partner for a re-review.
    - _Repeat this process as many times as necessary._
- Merge your PR after the final approval from your partner.
