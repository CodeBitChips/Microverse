# Does my coding partner follow JS best practices?

## Learning objectives
- Give feedback on someone else's project based on clean code best practices.
- Apply knowledge the student has gained in the past when giving a code review.
- Perform a simple code review for a coding partner.
- Understand existing code in a way that allows the student to give a good code review.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

In the ["Better communication in code reviews" lesson](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/better_code_review.md), you have read and think a lot about the quality of your code and communication in code reviews. 
Now it is time for you to perform a code review for your partner!
_We asked Code Reviewers to ignore any issues related to best practices or clean code rules during their reviews._
Because of that, now you can find all of them by yourself.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

### Preparation
- Create a new empty repo.
- Copy your code from the "To Do list" project and commit it as one big chunk of code in a feature branch.
- Open a pull request.
- Ask you partner for a review in [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).
- Share the pull request link with your partner.

### Instructions

- Once you get a pull request link from your partner, go ahead and review it:
    - Reminder: [How to give a code review](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/give_code_review_basics.md).
- Check the quality of the code (you can use previous lessons as a guide). Remember to check for the following:
    - [JavaScript best practices](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md ).
    - [DRY, KISS, and YAGNI](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/clean-code/lesson_DRY_KISS_YAGNI.md) rules.
    - [HTML & CSS best practices](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).
- Finish your review with a nice summary.
- Compare your review with the issue created by the project's author in the [Do I follow JavaScript best practices?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/clean-code/exercises/clean_code_self_assessment.md) exercise.
    - _There is no need to add anything to your review at this point. It is just to check if you both noticed the same issues._
- Check the review you received from your partner! You will make improvements to your code based on your partner's review in the next exercise.

#### How to split work into a group of 3 students

If you happen to have three people in your group, follow this scenario:
- Student A gives a review to student B.
- Student B gives a review to student C.
- Student C gives a review to student A.
