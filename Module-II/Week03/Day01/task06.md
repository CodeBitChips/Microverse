# Do I follow JavaScript best practices?

## Learning objectives
- Assess your own project based on how well it aligns with clean code best practices.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Exercise

In the previous lesson, you have read and think a lot about the quality of your code. Now it is a time for a self-assessment!
_We asked code reviewers to ignore any issues related to best practices or clean code rules during their reviews._
Thanks to that, now you can find all of them by yourself.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** instructions before you start this exercise.*

### Instructions

- Open your "To Do list" project.
- Open a [new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) for each best practice topic.
- Check the quality of your code (hint: you can use previous lessons as a guide). Be mindful of the following as you check your code:
    - [JavaScript best practices](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/javascript_best_practices.md).
    - [DRY, KISS, and YAGNI](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/clean-code/lesson_DRY_KISS_YAGNI.md) rules.
    - [HTML and CSS best practices](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/html_css_best_practices.md).
 - List all issues that you find in the GitHub issue. Provide links to specific lines of code.
 - **IMPORTANT NOTE:** do not fix the issues that you found! You will still need them to be present in your repo for the next exercises.
