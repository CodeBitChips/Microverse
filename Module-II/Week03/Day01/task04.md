# DRY, KISS, and YAGNI

## Learning objectives

- Understand what DRY, KISS, and YAGNI stand for and be able to explain why these ideas are important in programming.

### Estimated time: 0.75h

## Description

**DRY, KISS, YAGNI**? What are you talking about? They are just acronyms of common best practices to write *clean code*. In this lesson, you will learn what they mean and why they are important.

### Why is clean code important?

There is not a single coding style or a rigid set of rules that every programmer should follow. Given the number of existing programming languages, paradigms, and personal styles, that's simply impossible. But there are some *principles* that the community has embraced, independent of the language you are working in. Some of the most popular are:

- **DRY:** Don't repeat yourself! It simply means you should try to avoid having duplicated code. Instead, you should reuse your code when possible. *Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system* (Andrew Hunt & David Thomas, "The Pragmatic Programmer").

- **KISS:** Keep It Simple, Stupid. No further explanation is needed! Try to avoid unnecessary complexity, don't *over-engineer* your code. A simple, small, and easy-to understand code base is easier to maintain and scale.

- **YAGNI:** You Aren't Gonna Need It. Don't add anything you don't strictly need. Try to avoid the temptation of adding the most trendy technologies just because you think they may be useful in the future. Add things gradually, when they are *really* needed.

- Read the article [Basic refactoring: don't repeat yourself](https://www.taniarascia.com/refactoring-dont-repeat-yourself/), in which the author explains the process of refactoring a piece of code following the DRY principle (KISS and YAGNI are also applicable in this example).
- Read the article [KISS => Keep It Simple, Smart](https://medium.com/infancyit/kiss-keep-it-simple-smart-javascript-habits-b019ce14b5ec), which contains a list of techniques that could improve your code (remember, there is no *right way* to do it, every engineer may do it in a different way).

## Additional materials

**These are all optional, but if you're interested in exploring this topic further, here are some resources to help you. Any exploration here should be done outside program time.**
