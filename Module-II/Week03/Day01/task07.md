# Better communication in code reviews

## Learning objectives
- Communicate issues with code review feedback in a respectful way.
- Write clear, professional, and respectful review comments for other team members.
- Explain "why" a change is requested when giving a code review.

### Estimated time: 1h

## Description

Code review is a process that you experience almost every day of your Microverse adventure.
You receive code reviews for all your projects, and you give code reviews to your peers in morning sessions.
Now it is time to reflect more on the best ways to communicate during the code review process.

### Why is this important?

Both sides - the reviewer and the author - are active members of the code review process.
It is important to remember that both are in the same team and care about the quality of the code. Even if sometimes both sides can make mistakes.
In order to avoid issues and make the code review process smooth, it is essential to talk to each other and to do it in a professional way.

In addition - traces of conversations between a code reviewer and code's author left in pull requests can be a piece of valuable information for your future employer!

### Refresher on a healthy code review mindset and communication

Let's start by re-visiting the following articles. Is there anything there that you have missed before?

- Read [Bringing a healthy code review mindset to your team](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/06/bringing-healthy-code-review-mindset/) by Sandrina Pereira.
- Read [A Guide to Mindful Communication in Code Reviews](https://kickstarter.engineering/a-guide-to-mindful-communication-in-code-reviews-48aab5282e5e) by Amy Ciavolino.

### Check examples of good communication in pull requests

GitHub pull requests are a great tool to maintain a record of communication about your project. Thanks to pull requests, the context of your conversation is super clear since you can comment directly below a piece of code. 
The other advantage is that you can keep the history of the changes in your code and their reasons in one place. If you ever need to understand why you wrote a specific line of code, you would be able to track it in GitHub.

Take a look at the list of example pull requests in some open-source projects and how people talk to each other in comments:
- Example of a pretty long discussion below a specific line of code in [react-native PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31428#pullrequestreview-650530480).
- Example of inline comments in [another react-native PR](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31384#pullrequestreview-642762025).
- Example conversation in [freeCodeCamp PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/42137).

### Challenge yourself

Take time to reflect on the idea of good communication in code reviews.  Ask yourself the following questions:

- How do you communicate with code reviewers? Do you use GitHub pull requests for that?
- How professional and clear are you with your GitHub comments?
- How do you communicate issues with the code reviews that you receive?
- Can you find any good examples of communication in PRs in some open-sourced projects?
