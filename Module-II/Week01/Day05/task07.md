- As this challenge should be solved by doing a pair-programming, first decide who will be the driver and who will be the navigator:
    - You won't switch roles during the challenge as you cannot invite collaborators to the private repo.
    - Make sure that you and your coding partner(s) experience both roles (the driver and the navigator) in a given week. _For example: if you were the navigator while solving the challenge yesterday, make sure that today you are the driver._
- The driver shares their screen and accepts the [Queue](https://classroom.github.com/a/QBHu02ej) assignment.
- Check the instructions in the assignment README.
- Try pseudocoding first.
- Feel free to use the video from the previous lesson.
- Once you solve the challenge, copy the GitHub link to the repository that includes your solution.
