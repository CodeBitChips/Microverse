# Code review - what does it really mean?

## Learning objectives

- Understand the code review process as a team effort.
- Use the "Review changes" feature from GitHub.
- Write clear and professional review comments.


### Estimated time: 0.75h

## Description

You already know how to ask for a code review, and you have already received your first code review. Now it is time to make sure that you understand **why** code review is such a powerful and widely adopted process. Soon you will be giving code reviews to other students, so you need to prepare for that as well.

### Why is it important?

We are all only human and our mental powers are limited but if we make an effort to combine the "computing powers" of all of our brains we can achieve more as a group. Working on code together helps us to avoid mistakes, improve our skills, prevent bugs (or sometimes even disasters), and figure out better solutions.

### The beauty of the code review

Code review is a very simple idea: someone else looks at your code and gives you feedback on the code. It is amazing how many benefits this simple process has though. Read about them in the following  articles:

- [Wikipedia definition of the code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review). **NOTE: read only the introduction part. It should take you less than 5 minutes.**
- [Why review code?](https://sophiebits.com/2018/12/25/why-review-code.html) by Sophie Alpert who shares personal experiences about the code review process and emphasizes the benefits of code review for the entire team.

We will come back to the code review process after you have experienced a bit more of it. For now, we would like to leave you with this quote as inspiration:

>“An amateur is defensive. The professional finds learning (and even, occasionally, being shown up) to be enjoyable; they like being challenged and humbled, and engage in education as an ongoing and endless process. (...)”

>— Ryan Holiday, Ego Is the Enemy

### How to give a code review



You will have a chance to give a code review pretty soon. In order to do that well:
- Learn about [Commenting on a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) in GitHub.
- Read this [step by step guide](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/code-review/articles/give_code_review_basics.md). 


### Challenge yourself

Take time to reflect on the idea of the code review.  Ask yourself the following questions:

- How many benefits of code reviews can you already remember?
- Which benefit do you consider to be the most important one?
- Do you think that you will be able to think of code reviews as an opportunity to learn, even if you receive a code review that points out several ways your code should be modified to improve it?
- Do you think that you will be able to give a nice and respectful code review to someone else?
